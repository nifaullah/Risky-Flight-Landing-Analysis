# Risky-Flight-Landing-Analysis

Academic Project: Predicting what factors affect risky flight landing using Linear Regression in R.

Goal: To study what factors and how they would impact the landing distance of a commercial flight.
Data: Landing data (landing distance and other parameters) from 950 commercial flights (not real data set but simulated from statistical models). See two Excel files ‘FAA-1.xls’ (800 flights) and ‘FAA-2.xls’ (150 flights).

Language Used: R

Approach: Multiple Linear Regression

Major Finding: Speed Air, Aircraft & Height are the most influencing factors.
